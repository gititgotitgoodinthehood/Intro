Hello

# Intro

I dont' really have any interests. I have dogs, watch TV, exercise, and go to work. 
Now I am starting a M.S. in data science at Eastern University
I do not understand why I have to create this file to be eligible for the student account that I am already eligible for. 
Thank you.

## Holding1

This project is an exploration of [insert topic or dataset here]. My goal is to apply fundamental data science techniques to extract insights and build my skills in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. 

This project includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Simple modeling (optional)

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. I recommend using `conda` to manage your environment. You can set up the environment using the following commands:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd your-repo-name

# Create a conda environment
conda create --name myenv python=3.9

# Activate the environment
conda activate myenv

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
